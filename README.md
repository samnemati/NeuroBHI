## Overview

The pipeline consists of three scripts that run sequentially:

## Script 1 — `BHI_ROI_brainage_calculation_from_ROIVol.m` (MATLAB)

### What it does

Estimates a **predicted brain age** for every subject in every brain region using a Leave-One-Out (LOO) ridge-regularized linear regression trained on healthy controls.

1. **Loads** a volBrain Excel file containing regional volumes (cm³), chronological age, and a `UseForEstimation` flag.
2. **Auto-detects TIV** (Total Intracranial Volume) — first looks for a column containing "intracranial" or "(IC)"; falls back to `Brain(WM+GM) + CSF`.
3. **Auto-detects region columns** — any column whose name contains both "volume" and "cm3".
4. **TIV-normalizes** all volumes (divides by TIV) so brain age reflects relative regional proportions rather than absolute sizes.
5. **Leave-One-Out regression** per subject × per region:
   - Removes the subject from the control pool if they are a control.
   - Fits `Age ~ TIV-normalized volume` on the remaining controls using OLS; switches to ridge regularization (λ = 0.001) when the design matrix is ill-conditioned or underdetermined.
   - Predicts the subject's brain age from their own normalized volume.
   - Computes an **atrophy score** = mean Z-score of the subject's volumes relative to controls.
6. **Computes Brain Age Gap (BAG)** = predicted age − chronological age, and **Proportional BAG** = BAG / chronological age.
7. **Saves** three output Excel files and generates box plots for visual inspection.

### Inputs

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `subject_ID` | Subject identifier (required for labelled output) |
| `Age` | Chronological age in years |
| `UseForEstimation` | `"Within Range"` = control, `"Outside Range"` = test |
| TIV column | Auto-detected (intracranial cavity or WM+GM+CSF) |
| `<Region> volume cm3` | One column per brain region (auto-detected) |

### Outputs

| File | Sheet | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `volBrain_Regional_BrainAge.xlsx` | `Brain_Age` | Predicted brain age [nSubjects × nRegions] |
| `volBrain_ROI_BrainAgeGaps.xlsx` | `Brain_Age_Gap` | BAG = predicted − chronological age |
| `volBrain_Regional_PropBrainAgeGaps.xlsx` | `Prop_Brain_Age_Gap` | Proportional BAG = BAG / chronological age |

Box plots are saved as `Brain_age.png`, `Brain_age_gap.png`, `Brain_age_gap_PBA.png`.

### Requirements

- MATLAB R2019b or later
- No toolboxes required

### Usage

1. Set `datafile` in the USER CONFIGURATION section.
2. Run the script.
3. Check console diagnostics: TIV column detected, number of regions, LOO progress.
4. Inspect the three output Excel files. Feed `volBrain_ROI_BrainAgeGaps.xlsx` into Script 2.

## Script 2 — `BHI_compute_regionalBAG_from_roiBAG.m` (MATLAB)

### What it does

Aggregates ROI-level BAG values (from Script 1) into anatomical lobe groups and functional network groups, weighted by regional brain volume.

1. **Loads** the ROI-BAG table (output of Script 1) and the volBrain volume table.
2. **Fuzzy-matches** each ROI-BAG column name to its corresponding volume column by tokenizing names (lowercasing, expanding abbreviations like `L`→`left`, `WM`→`white matter`), scoring by token overlap + hemisphere-match bonus − edit-distance penalty, and selecting the best match per ROI. Falls back to normalized Levenshtein distance when no token overlap is found.
3. **Saves** the ROI → volume column mapping to Excel for inspection and manual correction.
4. **Groups** ROIs into:
   - **Anatomical groups**: Frontal, Temporal, Parietal, Occipital × Left, Right (8 groups)
   - **Functional network groups**: DomainGeneral, LanguageSpecific, CinguloOpercular × Left, Right (6 groups)
5. **Computes** both a simple (unweighted) mean BAG and a volume-weighted mean BAG per group per subject. Missing ROI volumes are imputed with the group mean; if all volumes are missing, falls back to simple mean.
6. **Saves** all results to a single multi-sheet Excel file.

### Inputs

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `roiBAG_file` | ROI-BAG Excel file (`volBrain_ROI_BrainAgeGaps.xlsx` from Script 1) |
| `volumes_file` | volBrain volume Excel file (same as Script 1 input); must contain `subject_ID` |

### Outputs

| File | Sheet | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `ROI_to_Vol_Mapping.xlsx` | — | ROI-BAG column → matched volume column, match score, edit distance. **Inspect before use.** |
| `Regional_BAGs_weighted_v2.xlsx` | `RegionalBAGs_mean` | Simple mean BAG per group |
| | `RegionalBAGs_weighted` | Volume-weighted mean BAG per group |
| | `ROI_to_Vol_Mapping` | Copy of the mapping table |

### Functional network definitions

| Network | Included regions |
|---|---|
| **DomainGeneral** | Superior/middle frontal, precentral, supramarginal, insula, anterior/posterior cingulate, supplementary motor, frontal operculum |
| **LanguageSpecific** | Inferior frontal (opercular/triangular/orbital), superior/middle temporal, planum temporale/polare, temporal pole, angular, supramarginal, Heschl's gyrus, fusiform |
| **CinguloOpercular** | Anterior/middle cingulate, insula, frontal operculum, supplementary motor |

### Requirements

- MATLAB R2019b or later
- No toolboxes required

### Usage

1. Set the four file paths in the USER CONFIGURATION section.
2. Run the script.
3. Open `ROI_to_Vol_Mapping.xlsx` and verify matches — correct any mismatches manually.
4. Use `Regional_BAGs_weighted_v2.xlsx` (weighted sheet) as input to Script 3.

## Script 3 — `stepwise_BAG_behavioral.py` (Python)

### What it does

Runs a **bidirectional stepwise OLS regression** for each brain region, modeling the volume-weighted regional BAG as a function of behavioral scores, with Age always retained as a fixed covariate.

For each region:
1. Fits an **age-only model** and saves its residuals (age-partialled BAG).
2. Runs **bidirectional stepwise selection** over all behavioral predictors:
   - **Forward step**: adds the candidate with the lowest p-value if p < 0.05.
   - **Backward step**: removes any currently-selected predictor if its p-value exceeds 0.10.
   - Repeats until no predictor is added or removed.
3. Fits the **final model** (Age + selected predictors) and saves its residuals and coefficient table.

### Inputs

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `ABC_RegBAG_Clcalc_weightedVol.xlsx` | Regional BAG file — weighted sheet from Script 2 |
| `Behavioral_Data_Cleaned.xlsx` | Cleaned behavioral scores; must contain `subject_ID` and `Age` |

Tables are merged on `subject_ID`. Listwise deletion is applied — subjects missing any predictor or outcome are excluded.

### Regions modeled

`Language_Specific`, `Domain_General`, `Frontal`, `Temporal`, `Parietal`, `Occipital`, `Subcortical`, `Cerebellum`, `Limbic`

### Stepwise parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Entry threshold | p < 0.05 |
| Removal threshold | p > 0.10 |
| Fixed covariate | Age (always retained, never removed) |
| Missing data handling | Listwise deletion |

### Outputs

All results written to `Stepwise_BAG_Behavioral_Results.xlsx`:

| Sheet | Contents |
|---|---|
| `Summary` | One row per region: N, R², Adj-R², F-statistic, F p-value, number and names of selected predictors |
| `<Region>` | Full coefficient table: predictor, coefficient, SE, t-value, p-value, 95% CI |
| `Final_Model_Residuals` | Residuals from the final model (Age + selected predictors) per subject |
| `Age_Corrected_Residuals` | Residuals from the age-only model (age-partialled BAG) per subject |

### Requirements

```
pandas
numpy
statsmodels
openpyxl
```

```bash
pip install pandas numpy statsmodels openpyxl
```

### Usage

```bash
python stepwise_BAG_behavioral.py
```

Ensure both input Excel files are in the same directory, or update the file paths in the configuration section at the top.
